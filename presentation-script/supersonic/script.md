# Who are we? - Lyubo

Hello! I'm Lyubo Lyubchev and I'm Simo Aleksandrov.

We are a team of 2 16 year old full stack developers from Ruse called Delirium Products.

Today we are going to present you our latest project called **LuncherBox.**

Our goal is to save people's money, time and effort!

## Problem - Lyubo

Have you ever had to wait for a very long period of time at a restaurant, just to have your order taken?

Both of us have experienced this many times, which motivated us to figure out a solution.

We noticed one more issue - the high turnover for waiters at restaurants. The entire process could be almost automated, resulting to an increase in revenue.

## Solution - Simo

LuncherBox - Interactive Menu is a web app which aims making placing orders by clients in restaurants a much faster task.

Other than the satisfied customers, the restaurant owners will save money by lowering the required amount of waiters to a minimum.

The clients of the restaurant will place orders through LuncherBox, which will send the request to the kitchen, where it will be processed through the app.

## How does it work? - Lyubo

Each restaurant will sign up for our platform and will be provided its very own customized interactive menu.

After signing up, they will get access to their very own Admin Panel where they can start populating their menu list.

After a customer gets in the restaurant, the only thing left is for them to open the website through their phones.
